-Use cookies or some such to allow users to edit song choices

-Provide tipping functionality or something?  Venmo API?

-How can I handle a repeatedly refreshing song list for free?  do I set it up with a home server or some crazy shit?

-Should I track most popular?

-Total Song List:
-Postgres with GraphQL
-What backend framework?  Django vs Express?
-Fields: Title, Artist, req num?, forbidden zone that only gets played with bribery?, some id that's in the monkey system?
-

Frontend:
-React + Recoil for state management
-Use localstorage for login somehow, look for secure solution?  How to make it only accessible on the one device?
-

MOST POPULAR:
-Use either a paging algorithm or actually track reqs
-Either way, use redis for it

COMING UP:
-Redis DB
-Just add to end of list for new additions
-Do I be that dude and directly enable bribery?
